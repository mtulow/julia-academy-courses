# Julia for Data Science

There are three main components in this tutorial.

- Data (1 notebook)
- Methods (10 notebooks)
- Visualization (1 notebook)

## Course

Every data science task has one main ingredient, the data! Most likely, you want to use your data to learn something new. But before the new part, what about the data you already have? This is why our first section is on Data.

### __Data__

In the first part we will make sure you can

read and save your data via various File I/O options
store, reformat, and process your data using different data structures.
‚≠êBonus: we will also cover quick basic Julia syntax in case this is your first Julia experience.
Next, we will explore some of the most popular methods and tools used in Data Science to process this data.

### __Methods__

In this section, we hope to give you (the data scientist) all the tools you need to use Julia as a programming language for your data science tasks. This includes

understanding how Linear Algebra and Statistics tasks are performed in Julia
going through some of the most popular data science methods such as classification, regression, clustering, and more.
calling your existing Python, R, or C code from Julia.
And finally, we will go over a few visualizations that will hopefully reveal a few tips and tricks to generate good looking and informative visualizations.

### __Visualization__

Note that the methods section will show several kinds of plots too. But here, we will cover plotting tools that we didn't get to in the Methods section.

This includes:

- statiscs plots
- managing the axes (double axes)
- showing error bars
- managing colors and color schemes
- plot annotations.

## Expectations
